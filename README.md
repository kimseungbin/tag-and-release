# Tag and Release

This repository demonstrates how to automate the release process using semantic versioning and GitHub Actions.
It provides a simple and effective way to manage versioned releases, ensuring consistent version control and streamlined
workflows.
By leveraging a custom JavaScript GitHub Action, this project helps you automate the creation of GitHub Releases based
on tagged versions.

# Features

## Label Checker

This application manages semantic versioning labels (`major`, `minor`, and `patch`) for issues and pull requests,
automatically creating them if they don't exist. These labels are essential for determining version bumps and
maintaining consistent release workflow.

### Default Label Configuration

The following labels are automatically managed:

| Label | Description           | Color   |
|-------|-----------------------|---------|
| major | Breaking Changes      | #FF0000 |
| minor | New Features          | #00FF00 |
| patch | Bug fixes and patches | #0000FF |

### Usage

The label checker runs automatically when tag-and-release action is ran.
